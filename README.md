# DesignTokens

The design system's values, held once as typed Swift and generated for every surface that cannot import Swift.

**Status:** pre-release (`0.x`, latest 0.3.0). Phase 1 of `project/master_plan.md`.

## What it holds

- **Colour roles** (`ColorToken`): the nine SwiftGUIKit roles plus `onAccent` and `link`, each with a light and a dark value.
  A dark value that has not been measured on the snapshot release is `nil` and listed in
  `ColorToken.unmeasuredDark`; it is not guessed. Today that list is empty.
  Increased-contrast values (`increasedContrastLight`, `increasedContrastDark`) are measured on macOS 27.2
  from a real app with Increase Contrast on, for `accent`, `success` and `destructive`. Everything else is
  `nil` (listed in `ColorToken.unmeasuredIncreasedContrast`), not guessed: `label`, `secondaryLabel` and
  `separator` carry alpha, which a hex readout loses; `background`, `secondaryBackground` and `onAccent` are
  this package's own values; `warning` has no system colour; and the measured system `link` has *less*
  contrast than this package's link, so it is deliberately not adopted.
- **Palette** (`Palette`): eight series colours in a validated order, in light (`series`) and dark
  (`seriesDark`, measured) and with Increase Contrast on (`seriesIncreasedContrast`,
  `seriesIncreasedContrastDark`, measured); the sequential ramp, and `sequentialDark` (the same ramp reversed, derived, not
  measured); the diverging ramp (no dark ramp yet: its tints would have to be invented); and Princeton
  orange as a custom accent.
- **Metrics** (`Rule`, `Grid`, `Radius`): rule weights 1, 3 and 8 pt; a 12-column grid with a 16 pt gutter
  and a 4 pt base; container radius 0, control radius 4 pt.

- **Typography** (`FontStack`, `TypeStyle`): SF with a Helvetica fallback as the default; New York and
  Garamond stacks as a switch; six type roles from label to display.

Not yet here: increased-contrast values for the roles listed above, and a dark diverging ramp.

## Platforms

Foundation only. Builds on macOS, iOS, visionOS and Linux. It holds data, not `Color` values: on Apple
platforms a resolver should use the system's own colours (the HIG says not to hard-code them), and the
values here are a labelled snapshot (`Snapshot.systemRelease`) for web, SVG, slides and spreadsheets.

## Generating the files

```
swift run design-tokens Generated
```

writes `Generated/tokens.css` and `Generated/tokens.json`. Both are committed, and a test fails if either
differs from a fresh emit, so regenerate and commit after changing a value.

The CSS has `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` blocks (light, then `and (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`, then the
explicit dark selectors), ordered so the dark scheme wins over the light contrast block and the dark contrast
block wins over the standard dark values.

## Requirements

Swift 6.2 or later.
